# Portfolio-Andrew Hall

## Description

This is a portfolio showcasing some of my first projects that I have worked on using HTML, CSS, and Git. My main project is a website for online marketing techniques that I refactored to improve its accessibility. I have also included a smaller personal project that I made to practice some basic HTML and CSS styling. The portfolio contains a picture of me and my email in addition to links to my Github and Linkedin accounts. You can also find a downloadable copy of my resume in the navigation bar.
